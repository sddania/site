Speaking in public is not easy, especially for geeks, that tend to be too technical, or too shy, or too something...

In this session, we'll start with some basic tips, and we'll see how to dramatically improve our results using well-defined techniques.

We'll also see (with practical examples) how to deal with problems during speeches, elevator pitches, product presentations, interviews, and so on.

Public speaking skills are not useful to conference speakers only, everybody needs to improve them, especially geeks!
