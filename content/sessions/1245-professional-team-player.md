Every developer wanna be The Hero (tm), right?! 

Everybody likes to stand under the spotlight and "be recognized"!

Well, I Do!

But over time I've learnt that being a "Professional" is harder than being "The Hero"; and being a "Professional Team Player" is even harder!

Looking at my own failures, these are the things I do to improve myself, to be a better "Professional", to be a better "Team Player".
